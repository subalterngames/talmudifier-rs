Talmudifier uses JSON config files for typesetting. example_talmudifier.json is an example config file. To make your own config file, copy+paste the example and edit as needed. It should be mostly human-readable. Many of the values in the config file are measurements of lengths. The following units are valid: "In", "Cm", "Mm", "Pt", "Em". *However*, there are many cases in which "Em" is not valid. This is because many of the lengths need to be converted to Pts and there's no easy way to do what with Ems because they're font-specific. I recommend using Em for values only where example_talmdufier.json uses Em. "fonts" has a default value of null, in which case default fonts embedded in the executable are used. You can set this to use other fonts. See example_fonts.json; you can replace null with the text in example_fonts.json (assuming that the files actually exist). Limitations: - Each font style (regular, bold, etc.) *must* be a separate file. - A column's font files must all be in the same directory. - System fonts are not supported. A very subset of markdown is used in Talmudifier: For the most part, just type text like you normally would. You can italicize text like *this*. You can make text bold like **this**. You can make bold and italic text like ***this***. **You can make multiple words bold and you can *italicize* within bold text** (*and **vice** versa*). `If you want to add marginalia, use graves.` Links, images, headers, emoji, etc. are not supported.
