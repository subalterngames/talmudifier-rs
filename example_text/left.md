Talmudifier uses JSON config files for typesetting. example_talmudifier.json is an example config file. To make your own config file, copy+paste the example and edit as needed. It should be mostly human readable. Many of the values in the config file are measurements of lengths. The following units are valid: In, Cm, Mm, Pt, Em. *However*, there are many cases in which Em is not valid. This is because many of the lengths need to be converted to Pts and there's no easy way to do what with Ems because they're font specific. I recommend using Em for values only where example_talmdufier.json uses Em. You can also optionally set the per column fonts. If you don't, and if you've included the default features feature, default fonts will be used. Limitations:  Each font style (regular, bold, etc.) *must* be a separate file.  A column's font files must all be in the same directory.  System fonts are not supported. For the most part, just type text like you normally would. You can italicize text like this. You can make text bold like this. You can make bold and italic text like this. You can make multiple words bold and you can italicize within bold text (and vice versa). `If you want to add marginalia, use graves.` Links, images, headers, emoji, etc. are not supported.
