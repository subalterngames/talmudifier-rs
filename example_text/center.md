**Generate PDFs with page layouts similar to the Talmud.** Given three paragraphs of markdown text, Talmudifier will generate a .pdf file using XeTeX (via Rust's tectonic crate). You can also include a title, basic styling (bold, italic, etc.) and marginalia. This is a Rust port of my Talmudifier Python module. It's faster now.
