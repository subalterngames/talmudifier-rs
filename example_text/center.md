**Generate PDFs with page layouts similar to the Talmud.** Given three paragraphs of markdown text, Talmudifier will generate a .pdf file using XeTeX (via Rust's tectonic crate). You can also include a title, basic styling (bold, italic, etc.) and marginalia. This is a Rust port of my Talmudifier Python module. It's easy! You don't need to be a programmer to use Talmudifier. 1. Download and extract this repo 2. Download and install Rust 3. Open a terminal shell. - Windows: Search for powershell and run it - macOS: Search for terminal and run it - Linux: You know what to do 4. In the terminal, type cd [PATH] and press enter. *Do not literally type* [PATH]. That's a substitute word for whatever the actual path to the repo is. For example, if you extracted the repo in Downloads, then: cd $\sim$/Downloads/talmudifier 5. Compile as an executable 6. Create a valid talmudifier.json file
