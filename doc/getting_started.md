It's easy! You don't need to be a programmer to use Talmudifier.

1. [Download and extract this repo](https://github.com/subalterngames/talmudifier-rs/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
2. [Download and install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
3. Open a terminal shell. 
  - Windows: Search for `powershell` and run it
  - macOS: Search for `terminal` and run it
  - Linux: You know what to do
4. In the terminal, type `cd [PATH]` and press enter. *Do not literally type* `[PATH]`. That's a substitute word for whatever the actual path to the repo is. For example, if you extracted the repo in Downloads, then: `cd ~/Downloads/talmudifier`
5. [Compile as an executable](#compile-as-an-executable)
6. [Create a valid talmudifier.json file](#talmudifierjson)
