A very subset of markdown is used in Talmudifier:

For the most part, just type text like you normally would. You can italicize text like \*this\*. You can make text bold like \*\*this\*\*. You can make bold and italic text like \*\*\*this\*\*\*. \*\*You can make multiple words bold and you can \*italicize\* within bold text\*\* (\*and \*\*vice\*\* versa\*). \`If you want to add marginalia, use graves.\`

Links, images, headers, emoji, etc. are not supported.
